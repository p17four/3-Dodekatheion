Hi,

I am Georgios Fournaris and this is my thesis project for Ionian University department of Informatics.

I was task with the the development of an augmented reality application that provides historical information.

This app was designed to be used by tourist as a first introduction to the Greek Pantheon, with some statues or temples accompanying the gods and useful infomation.

Inside the application on the menu there is a guide on how to use it.

Thank you for downloading if you have any problems or creative ideas, feel free to contact me.
